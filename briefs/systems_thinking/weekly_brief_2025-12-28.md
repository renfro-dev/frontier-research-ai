# Systems Thinking Weekly Brief: December 2025

## Executive Summary

December 2025 has been marked by significant advancements in AI model development, with both proprietary and open-source models making notable strides. OpenAI released GPT-5.2 [1] and introduced new evaluation frameworks for biological research [2], while Google DeepMind strengthened partnerships with security institutions [6] and released new interpretability tools [7]. The open model ecosystem has experienced dramatic performance improvements throughout 2025, with models from organizations like DeepSeek, Qwen, and Moonshot AI now rivaling closed models on key benchmarks [9].

The ecosystem is increasingly characterized by specialized applications and tools, from minimalist text editors [4] to AI-assisted biological research [2, 5] and speech-to-text models [9]. These developments are accompanied by growing attention to responsible AI use, as evidenced by OpenAI's Academy for News Organizations [3] and Google DeepMind's partnership with the UK AI Security Institute [6].

This brief synthesizes recent developments across the AI landscape, highlighting key trends, tensions, and implications for practitioners and researchers in the field.

## Key Developments

### Proprietary AI Model Updates

OpenAI has released GPT-5.2, the latest model in the GPT-5 series [1]. The safety mitigation approach for this model remains largely consistent with previous versions in the GPT-5 family [1]. Like its predecessors, GPT-5.2 was trained on diverse datasets, including publicly available internet information, data from third-party partnerships, and information provided by users or human trainers and researchers [1].

Beyond model updates, OpenAI is exploring real-world applications of AI in scientific research. They have introduced an evaluation framework to measure how AI can accelerate biological research in wet labs [2]. This framework includes using GPT-5 to optimize molecular cloning protocols, exploring both the promise and potential risks of AI-assisted experimentation [2].

Google DeepMind has also been active in advancing AI capabilities and safety. They are working with scientists to use AlphaFold to strengthen photosynthesis enzymes, aiming to create heat-tolerant crops that can withstand warming climates [5]. Additionally, they have deepened their partnership with the UK AI Security Institute (AISI) to collaborate on critical AI safety and security research [6]. In mid-December, they released Gemma Scope 2, making open interpretability tools available across the entire Gemma 3 family of language models [7].

### Open Model Ecosystem Growth

The open model landscape has experienced dramatic performance improvements throughout 2025 [9]. What was once seen as lagging behind proprietary models has evolved significantly, with open models now rivaling closed models on most key benchmarks, though closed models still dominate in real-world usage [9].

Several key players have emerged in the open model space. DeepSeek R1, released on January 20th, 2025 under the MIT license, inspired many Chinese labs to release their models openly and under open licenses [9]. Qwen3 has developed a comprehensive family of models covering general models, vision, coding, embedding, and reranker capabilities, overtaking Llama in terms of total downloads and as the most-used base model for fine-tuning [9].

Other notable open model developments include Moonshot AI's focused approach on one model line at a time, MiniMax M2's significant improvement over its predecessor, and Gemma 3's strong multilingual abilities and vision capabilities [9]. Specialized models like Parakeet 3 for speech-to-text have gained popularity for their performance and speed, with many applications switching from Whisper to this model [9].

The Allen Institute for AI (AI2) continues to release models with all data, code, weights, logs, and methods available openly [9]. Their Olmo 3 Think model involved changes to every aspect of the stack, from pretraining and evaluation to post-training [8]. The development process included reinforcement learning infrastructure and evaluating reasoning models [8].

### Specialized Tools and Applications

Beyond general-purpose AI models, specialized tools and applications continue to emerge. Anton Medvedev's textarea.my is a minimalist text editor that lives entirely in the browser and stores everything in the URL hash [4]. At approximately 160 lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it demonstrates elegant implementation of features like the contenteditable="plaintext-only" attribute (supported across modern browsers) and CompressionStream('deflate-raw') for compressing editor state [4]. The editor includes a custom save option triggered by keyboard shortcuts and uses the debounce function to ensure functions run at most once every specified time period [4].

In the biological research domain, Google DeepMind is using AlphaFold to strengthen photosynthesis enzymes for heat-tolerant crops [5], while OpenAI is applying GPT-5 to optimize molecular cloning protocols [2]. These applications demonstrate how AI tools are being adapted for specialized scientific research.

For media organizations, OpenAI has launched the OpenAI Academy for News Organizations, a learning hub built in partnership with the American Journalism Project and The Lenfest Institute [3]. The Academy offers training, practical use cases, and responsible-use guidance to support journalists, editors, and publishers as they adopt AI in reporting and operations [3].

### AI Safety and Interpretability

Safety and interpretability remain central concerns in AI development. OpenAI maintains consistent safety mitigation approaches across its GPT-5 model family [1], while Google DeepMind has strengthened its partnership with the UK AI Security Institute to collaborate on critical AI safety and security research [6].

Google DeepMind has released Gemma Scope 2, making open interpretability tools available across the entire Gemma 3 family [7]. These tools help the AI safety community deepen their understanding of complex language model behavior [7].

The development of Olmo 3 Think included significant focus on reinforcement learning infrastructure and evaluating reasoning models [8]. This approach demonstrates the importance of robust evaluation frameworks for ensuring AI systems reason effectively.

## Tensions & Conflicts

Several tensions emerge from the current AI landscape. While open models now rival closed models on most key benchmarks, closed models still dominate in real-world usage [9]. This suggests a disconnect between benchmark performance and practical utility that practitioners should consider when selecting models for deployment.

There is also tension between recognition and quality in the open model ecosystem. Some high-quality models, such as IBM's Granite series, receive insufficient attention despite pioneering features like togglable thinking per prompt [9]. This indicates that technical excellence alone may not drive adoption without effective communication and community engagement.

The balance between work and sustainability presents another conflict. Content creators in the AI space acknowledge potential burnout while simultaneously claiming alignment and motivation with their work [10]. This suggests ongoing tension between workload and sustainability that affects individuals contributing to the AI ecosystem.

## Implications

For builders and practitioners, these developments offer both opportunities and challenges. The dramatic improvement in open models provides more options for deployment, especially in scenarios requiring privacy, customization, or fine-tuning [9]. The specialized tools and applications demonstrate how AI can be integrated into specific domains, from text editing to biological research.

However, the disconnect between benchmark performance and real-world utility suggests that careful evaluation beyond standard metrics is necessary when selecting models for practical applications. The continued dominance of closed models in real-world usage indicates that factors beyond raw performance influence adoption and effectiveness [9].

The growing emphasis on safety, interpretability, and responsible use highlights the importance of considering ethical implications alongside technical capabilities. As AI systems become more powerful and widely deployed, frameworks for ensuring responsible development and use will be increasingly critical.
