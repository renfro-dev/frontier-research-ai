# Weekly Systems Thinking Brief - Cursor Rules

## User Context
**IMPORTANT:** The user is not a developer. When explaining technical concepts:
- Use plain English, not jargon
- Explain what commands do before showing them
- Break complex tasks into simple steps
- Use analogies to explain technical concepts
- Show exactly where to click/type/paste
- Don't assume prior technical knowledge

## Project Context
This system generates weekly briefings that synthesize AI/systems thinking content from trusted sources into accessible 1-2 page essays for non-technical operators and founders.

## Core Principles (Hard Constraints)

### Conservative Synthesis Only
- NO speculation beyond source material
- "Unknown / Insufficient Evidence" is a valid and preferred outcome
- Conflicting views MUST be surfaced, not resolved
- No prescriptions without evidence

### Citation Requirements
- Every claim must be cited (APA style)
- Paraphrase by default, quote sparingly
- Always link to original sources
- Source cards required for every referenced document

### Model Behavior
- Readability > verbatim fidelity
- Plain language for non-technical audience
- Concrete metaphors and tangible examples required
- Neutral teacher tone, no hype

### Guardrails
- Structured intermediate outputs (JSON) before prose
- Reviewer gate must pass before publication
- Zero hallucinated claims tolerance
- Reading time ≤10 minutes per brief

## Agent-Specific Guidelines

### Ingest Agent
- Fetch long-form content only (blogs, official posts)
- Preserve raw content indefinitely
- No interpretation at this stage
- Excluded: Twitter, podcasts, YouTube, replies
- v1: Use RSS feed parsers for accessible sources
- v2: Add Firecrawl MCP for bot-protected sources (e.g., OpenAI Research)
- Implement fallback strategy: RSS → HTML scraping → Firecrawl

### Extraction Agent
- Clean HTML → structured text
- Section segmentation only
- NO analysis or interpretation

### Analysis Agent
Output structured JSON with:
- `claims`: Factual assertions from source
- `metaphors`: Analogies used by author
- `examples`: Concrete instances
- `uncertainties`: Where author expressed doubt
- `conflicts`: Points of disagreement with other sources

### Synthesis Agent
- Translate structured data → readable prose
- No new claims beyond source material
- Force concrete examples for abstract concepts
- Surface tradeoffs explicitly
- Include "What this means for builders" section

### Reviewer Agent (Gate)
Check for:
- Citation coverage (every idea cited)
- Hallucination detection
- "Unknown" properly surfaced where needed
- Reading time ≤10 minutes
- ≥3 primary sources cited

## Output Format Requirements

Every weekly brief must include:
1. Executive framing (what changed and why it matters)
2. Key ideas (3-6 max)
3. Concrete metaphors and plain-language explanations
4. Conflicts & tensions where applicable
5. "What this means for builders" section
6. Source cards with APA citations

## Architecture Notes

### Storage
- Supabase Postgres: Raw content, extractions, summaries, briefs
- pgvector: Semantic search, deduplication, theme clustering

### Pipeline
1. Weekly cron → Ingest Agent
2. Extraction Agent → Clean content
3. Vector similarity check → Detect repetition
4. Analysis Agent → Structured JSON
5. Synthesis Agent → Draft prose
6. Reviewer Agent → Gate approval
7. Manual publish step

## Success Criteria
- M1: Weekly brief published consistently (≥4 consecutive weeks)
- M2: Each brief cites ≥3 primary sources (APA)
- M3: Zero hallucinated claims (Reviewer passes)
- M4: Reading time ≤10 minutes

## Code Style
- Conservative error handling
- Explicit type checking
- Document all agent prompts
- Log intermediate outputs for debugging
- Preserve raw source data indefinitely

## What NOT to Build (v1)
- Text search UI
- Email newsletter automation
- Social posting automation
- Multi-author submissions
- Tutorials or how-to guides
